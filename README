BoostingPL - Scalable and Parallel Boosting with MapReduce


What is BoostingPL?

  BoostingPL is a scalable and parallel machine learning tools for Boosting
  (What is Boosting? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boosting).

  This Project is based on this paper:
 
      Indranil Palit and Chandan K. Reddy, "Scalable and Parallel Boosting
      with MapReduce", IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering
      (TKDE), 2012.
   
  If you want to know the theory and demonstration of algorithms in BoostingPL
  , this paper provides references for further reading.

  The MapReduce platform we used is Apache Hadoop(http://hadoop.apache.org/)
  , which is an opensource project and is more popular than other 
  implementations of MapReduce. You can deploy it on Amazon EC2 or your own 
  cluster.
